### how to use:

i believe you already know the basics of how to open the console or developer tools on your pc, so i will be very straightforward.

open steam in your browser, go to the friends tab, then open the developer tools or console of your browser.
each browser has a different way to open it, but the quickest is to right-click anywhere, click on inspect, a page will open, and you just need to click on console. after opening the console, you copy the code from the "mass script" file, paste it into the console, and a box will open for you to write what you want to post on your steam friends' profiles and below to select all, some, or none.

you can user `%s` on the comment to script get friendly profile name and put in the comment,  e.g my steam name is `Yuri`, and if you use `whatsup %s?` in the comment, the script will comment `whatsup Yuri?`

that's it.

don't mess it up!
