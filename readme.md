# How to Use

This guide assumes you are familiar with opening the console or developer tools in your browser. Here's a straightforward method to use this script:

## Steps:

1. **Navigate to Steam Friends List:**
   - Open Steam in your web browser.
   - Navigate to the "Friends" tab.

2. **Open Developer Tools:**
   - **For most browsers:**
     - Right-click anywhere on the page.
     - Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element".
     - In the new window or tab that opens, switch to the "Console" tab.

   Note: The exact method might slightly differ based on your browser.

3. **Run the Script:**
   - **Copy the Code:** Open the file named "mass script" and copy all the JavaScript code.
   - **Paste in Console:** Paste the copied code into the browser's console and press Enter to execute it.

4. **Customize Your Message:**
   - A dialogue box will appear allowing you to:
     - Write your message in the provided text area.
     - Select which friends you want to send the message to (all, some, or none).

5. **Using Personalized Tags:**
   - You can use `%s` within your message to insert the friend's profile name automatically. For example:
     - If your message is `What's up, %s?`, and your friend's name is `Yuri`, the comment posted on Yuri's profile would read:
       ```
       What's up, Yuri?
       ```

## Important Notes:
- Ensure you've selected at least one friend before attempting to post comments.
- Be cautious with what you post, as there's no undo option for comments on Steam profiles.

That's all you need to know! Use this tool responsibly and enjoy mass commenting with ease.
